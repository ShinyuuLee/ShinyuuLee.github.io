<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever wanted to draw a fansy picture to visualize a kind of regularity or phenomenon?</li>

<p>Now that we have entered the era of big data, it is no exaggeration to say that changes that have been experienced by several generations long before could have been completed by us in just five years or ten years. Just a few days before the opening of this blog, the AlphaGo zero impressed people all around the world a lot. AI has begun to penetrate into all aspects of our lives, remarkably changing our original way of life &amp; views towards problems.</p>
<p>I think it’s benefical for everyone to understand some basic knowledge and principles about this aspect, whether to adapt to faster changes, or to master some useful tools which could be useful in relative projects engaged in. </p>
<p>To tell the truth, I was just getting start, which provides us a good opportunity to learn from each other and make progress together. If you are touched by me, focus on this blog, and let us achieve this goal together. This blog will start with some basic &amp; easy intro concepts, and then share some knowledge and insights which I believe you will love. What’s more, if you have something wanna to share in this platform, please tell me with no hesitation. </p>
